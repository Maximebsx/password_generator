# PASSWORD GENERATOR
This project was done in February 2022 as part of my "Introduction to Python" course. My group and I (we were 3) made a random password generator. Then we wanted to push the project in another dimension by associating this password to a QRCODE. Finally, we decided to close this project by adding the possibility to send this password and the associated QRCODE to an email chosen by the user.

I hope you will find my first project interesting.
